            There is a cart for buying products, and we can increase or decrease the number of products. By changing
            a parameter in the cart, our js functions calculate the cart total price. DOM, iterator, callback functions,
            string-array functions and events are used in our page. Additionally, we can remove products from the cart
            by clicking the remove button and decreasing the amount to "0". In that case, our page asks us to delete
            the product from the cart. As soon as you confirm the deletion, the sour chart total is recalculated by the js
            functions. Skills/Tools : DOM, Iterator, Callback functions, String-array functions and Events.
